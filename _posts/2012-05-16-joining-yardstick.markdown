title: Joining Yardstick Software
---
I am excited to announce that starting tomorrow I am going to be joining the team at [Yardstick Software](http://getyardstick.com) as Vice President of Product Development.

I've enjoying running [Burmis Studio](http://burmis.ca) for the past four years. I've worked on exciting projects with  terrific clients. I've learned how to run a team, manage budgets and develop successful products from conception to maintenance. With Yardstick I have the chance to take this to the next level. I can't wait to tackle new challenges with a team of smart, passionate and fun people.

Now lets go build some great software!
